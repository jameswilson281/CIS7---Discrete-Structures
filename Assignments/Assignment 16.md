# CIS 7 - Discrete Structures - Assignment 16
Due 2 Weeks before the final day of classes

    - [ ] Sketch a graph having nodes {1,2,3,4,5}, edges {a,b,c,d,e,f} and functions:
		- g(a) = (1,2)
		- g(b) = (1,3)
		- g(c) = (3,4)
		- g(d) = (3,4)
		- g(e) = (4,5)
		- g(f) = (5,5)
	- [ ] Using the graph from question #1, answer the following:		
		- Find two nodes that are not adjacent
		- Find a node adjacent to itself
		- Find a loop
		- Find two parallel edges
		- Find the degree of node 3
		- Find a path of length 5
		- Find a cycle
		- Is this graph complete?
		- Is this graph connected?
	- [ ] Draw a connected graph with:
		- 1 Vertex
		- 2 Vertices
		- 3 Vertices
		- 4 Vertices
		- 5 Vertices
