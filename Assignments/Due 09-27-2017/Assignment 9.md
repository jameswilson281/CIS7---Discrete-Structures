    - [ ] 2.2 Exercise 3:  Prove by induction that 1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4n-3) = n(2n-1)
	- [ ] Prove that for any positive integer number n, n^3 + 2n is divisible by 3			
	- [ ] Prove that for n >= 1, 9^n − 1 is divisible by 8 for all non-negative integers
			Hint: 4^(3+1) = 4 * 4^3
			Hint: If 9^n - 1 = 8m, then 9^n = 8m + 1
