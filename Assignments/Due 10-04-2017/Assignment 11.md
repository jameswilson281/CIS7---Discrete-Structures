# CIS 7 - Discrete Structures - Assignment 11s & 12
Due 2 Weeks before the last day of class

    - [ ] Write a program that asks the user for 2 positive integers, validates the input, and then prints out the GCD of those integers.
    - [ ] Use both the iterative method as well as the euclidean (recursive) method.
    - [ ] Print out the relative time difference that it took for each
        ```
Example Output: "GCD of 400 & 100 is 100.  Iterative method took 5ms, Euclidean method took 1ms."  Note that the times are just examples
